# Macro-scripts
A set of BASH scripts and C++ programs representing a complete workflow for processing macro focus stacking photographs. Utilizes other open source packages (dcraw, Hugin, ImageMagick) internally. The Deadpixels script (automatic detection of dead and hot pixels in raw photographs) can be of use for general photography, not just for macro photography.
